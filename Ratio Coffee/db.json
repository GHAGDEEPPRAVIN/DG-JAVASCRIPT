              "user-description" : "SO in love with this machine, brews wonderfully!! I will say the one thing to get used to is proper use of the bare ''button''. It is very easy to mistakenly activate a brew cycle while removing the basket.  The button is in the exact location that your thumb would naturally be for leverage of the basket removal.  It's a small thing but hopefully a consideration for the next version.  The form factor and overall size is wonderful and pairs very well next to my fellow grinder.  I particularly enjoy that I can place the water reservoir right on top!",

My first cup was outstanding, very smooth and balanced. I used a bright Kenya, and I was able to taste some fruit notes and plenty of clarity. I did a side-by-side comparison with the Fellow Aiden, and I found the Ratio 4 to be the better-tasting cup. I prefer not to deal with settings. I highly recommend this brewer. You get the benefit of a pour-over without the hassle of timing, and it has the built-in bloom feature. It does it all for you. I can now retire my Ratio 6 since it is larger than my needs. I have tried it with Kalita Wave, Hario Mugan, Hario V60, and Hario Switch. They all work!",
